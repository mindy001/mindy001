## 👩🏽‍💻 About Me

I'm Fazeeia, a Data Analyst and Data Scientist with a strong interdisciplinary background in Computer Science and Environmental & Natural Resource Management. My work focuses on using data to solve complex problems in sustainability, energy, business intelligence, and public good sectors.

With over 5 years of experience across analytics, AI, and machine learning, I've worked with banks, telecoms, NGOs, and climate-focused research teams. I specialize in developing data pipelines, dashboards, and predictive models that inform smarter decisions and create impact.

Currently, I'm pursuing an MSc in Data Science at the University of British Columbia, where my capstone project focuses on carbon-aware machine learning.
