## 👩🏽‍💻 About Me

Hi, I’m Fazeeia Data Scientist with a unique interdisciplinary background in Computer Science and Environmental & Natural Resource Management. I’m passionate about using data to drive change in sustainability, energy, business intelligence, and public-good sectors.

Over the past 5+ years, I’ve worked with banks, telecoms, NGOs, and climate research teams, building everything from real-time data pipelines to interactive dashboards and predictive models that solve real-world problems.

I believe data is the starting point for smarter, more intelligent systems  but it's creativity that defines how we shape those systems. While data science is rooted in rigor and logic, the real breakthroughs happen when we reimagine how we collect, structure, and communicate data. I’m deeply curious, always questioning the “why,” and constantly looking for more efficient, streamlined, and impactful solutions.
