## 👩🏽‍💻 About Me

I'm a Data Scientist with a unique interdisciplinary background in **Computer Science** and **Environmental & Natural Resource Management**. I'm passionate about driving data-informed decisions in **sustainability, energy, ESG, and social impact**.

With 5+ years of experience across **banking, telecom, energy, agriculture**, and **NGOs**, I’ve built everything from **real-time pipelines** and **ML models** to **interactive dashboards** that improve transparency, planning, and outcomes.

I believe **rigorous analysis meets its full potential through creativity and communication** from data collection to dashboard delivery. I'm always exploring ways to simplify complexity, question assumptions, and create smarter systems for people and the planet.
